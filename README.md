# Customer-Bookings-Predictive-Model
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

The first step carried out was to carefully explore the dataset in the “Getting Started” Jupyter Notebook to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then, the dataset was prepared for for a predictive model. 

After getting the data ready for modelling, the machine learning model was trained to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. Afterwards, the feature importance of each variable within the model was examined to determine which variable contributes to its predictive power. 

After training the model, I evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, I created a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, a summary of the findings was presented in a single slide.
